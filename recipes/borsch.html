    <h2>Recipe description</h2>

    <p>Borscht is a soup, usually made with beets, originating from Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It
        is especially popular in the cuisines of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Ukraine</p>

    <p> Although the beet version is the most well known, it doesn't have to be made with beets. Borscht was a
        wintersoup, often made with sour flavors and topped with a dollop of sour cream. </p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the shank slice or stewbeef.
                Let the beef brown lightly on one side, then turn over.</p>
            <p>Add the chopped onions to the pot. Let the onions cook and soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a
                simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss the beets and carrots with a
                teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan. Roast
                in
                preheated oven for 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Toss the potatoes with olive oil and make room for them in the roasting pan, and roast everything an
                additional 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, and take the pot off the heat. If you
                are using a beef shank, remove and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the meat
                into
                bite sized pieces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, beets, and potato. Add the chopped
                meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for
                another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the vinegar and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (I use about 2 teaspoons
                of
                salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper, but the amount you use will depend on how salty your beef broth is to
                begin
                with.)</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
